# 3D-plot-project

Whether it's for research, a school assignment, or a work presentation, 3-D plots are great for visualizing what a complicated set of data looks like. With the help of MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory), you'll be able to create stunning 3-D visuals with the data you provide. Using MATLAB for this purpose allows you to have complete control over the customization of your graph. From colors to shading and lighting, the only tools needed are MATLAB and your know-how.
